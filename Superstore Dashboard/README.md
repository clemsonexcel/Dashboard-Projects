## **Insights & Key Findings**  

The insights provided below are based on the entire dataset, covering all available years. Users can explore different areas using the interactive filters in the dashboard. 


#### **1. Sales Performance**  
- **Top-Selling Categories:** Among the three main categories—**Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies**—**Technology** generates the highest sales, followed by **Furniture**, with **Office Supplies** ranking last.  

- **Regional Sales Trends:** The West and East regions contribute the highest revenue, making them key markets for sales performance.  

- **Customer Segments:** The Consumer segment brings in the highest sales, followed by the Corporate segment, while the Home Office segment has the lowest sales.  

- **Shipping Mode & Sales Impact:** Standard Class shipping is the most preferred mode, driving the majority of sales.
This suggests that customers prioritize cost-effective shipping over faster options.  

#### **2. Profitability Analysis**  
- **Profitable vs. Unprofitable Products:** While **Technology** leads in sales, not all high-sales products are profitable. For example, the product **'TEC-MA-10002412'** ranks among the top three in sales but has a negative profit margin.  

- **Profit Margins by Category:**  
  - **Lowest profit subcategories:** Supplies, Bookcases, and Tables all have negative profit margins.  
  - **Highest profit subcategories:** Copiers, Phones, and Accessories generate the most profit.  
- **Regional Profitability:** The West and East regions, which rank highest in sales, also yield the highest profits.  
- **Seasonal Trends in Sales & Profit:**  
  - Sales exhibit a recurring pattern across multiple years.  
  - In Q1 and Q2, sales are generally lower, while Q3 and Q4 see a peak in sales and profit.  
  - This trend is consistent across years, suggesting a predictable sales cycle that could help with inventory and marketing planning.
