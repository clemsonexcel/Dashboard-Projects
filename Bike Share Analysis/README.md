üîπ **Power BI** ‚Äì Data visualization and dashboard creation 

#### **Data Preparation and SQL Query** 
Before building the dashboard in Power BI, the data was processed using SQL. The query below merges the datasets and selects the necessary columns for analysis:

```sql
with full_table as (
with shares_table as (
	SELECT * FROM bike_share_yr_0
	UNION ALL 
	SELECT *
	FROM bike_share_yr_1
)
select dteday,
	season,
    shares_table.yr,
    weekday,
    hr,
    rider_type,
    riders,
    price, 
    COGS,
    round(riders*price, 2) as revenue,
    round(riders*price - COGS*riders, 2) as profit
from shares_table
left join cost_table 
	on shares_table.yr = cost_table.yr
```

This transformed dataset was then loaded into Power BI for visualization.


#### **Key Insights & Findings**  
- Peak riding hour generate the most revenue, particularly during morning and evening commutes on weekdays, while weekends see stable ridership throughout the day.
